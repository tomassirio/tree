## Tree

A CLI program that lists your directories as a tree.

To download, open a terminal and type

```bash
Go111MODULE=on go get -u "github.com/tomassirio/tree"
```

then on your terminal you can use the command 

```bash
tree                                                                                       
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── list.go
├── readme.md
└── tree.go
```
